#  My Location

## Description
This is an iOS app that follows the tutorials of Raywenderlich's iOS Apprentice. The purpose of the app is to enable the user to tag their location and attach a description as well as a photo with that location. The user can then see a list view of all locations they have tagged  or see them on a map represented by pins.

## Project Status
The first stage of this project was to follow along with the tutorial. In the future, the goal is to add testing around all features and implement a more modular architecture.
